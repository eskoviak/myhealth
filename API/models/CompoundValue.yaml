  A compund value is one that has multiple parts, each of which is it
  self a scalar value.  An example of this is a blood pressure value, which
  has three parts:  The systolic pressure, the diastolic pressure and the
  heart rate.  Each is a unitized scalar value, but also is observed together.

  Example, the BP is measured at 120/80 mmHg at 60 bpm.
