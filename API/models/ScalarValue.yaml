  This is the model for a Scalar Value.

  Usage:  If the value to be represented is a unitless value, such as pi, place
          the value in the required value property, and leave the units property
          blank:

	  "ScalarValue" { "value" : 3.14159 }

          If the value is expressed with units, the units should be represented
          in the units field as either a string literal or a URI:

	  "ScalarValue" { "value" : 165, "units" : "lbm" }
	  *** TODO Add an example of a URI here ***

          Note:  a ratio such as 10% may be represented two ways:

          "Ratio" { "value" : 10, "units" : "%" } 

            or
  
          "Ratio" { "value" : 0.10 } for the same thing.
